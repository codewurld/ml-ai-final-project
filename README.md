# Machine Learning and AI for Business Solutions (Course)

## Context

This is a copy of my final project for my Machine Learning and AI for Business Solutions course at Teesside University.

## Project Overview

This project aims to apply two machine learning algorithms, namely, Logistics Regression and K-Nearest Neighbour to predict heart diseases in individuals in a given dataset. 

### Processes include:

- Collecting data -> in this case, from Kaggle
- Data preparation, preprocessing and analysis
- Model Building
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Predictions
- Final Report (submitted separately)

### Tools used:
- Python
- Libraries (Scikit Learn, Panda, Numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Dataset
Available from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)
